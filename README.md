# Clock Application - Unity Project

## Project Overview

This project will develop a multi-functional clock application in Unity that includes three main features:

- Standard Clock with time zone support
- Countdown Timer with notification support
- Stopwatch with lap recording functionality

The application will be designed with a clean architecture that allows for future integration with work operation applications.

## Technical Requirements

- Unity LTS Release 2021.3.4f1
- Reactive programming using UniRx
- Dependency Injection pattern implementation
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Cross-platform UI design (targeting Windows initially, with iOS/iPad compatibility in mind)

## Architecture Design

### Core Architecture

We will implement a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

```
├── Presentation Layer (UI/Views)
├── Application Layer (Controllers/Presenters)
├── Domain Layer (Business Logic/Services)
└── Infrastructure Layer (External Services/Data Access)
```

### Dependency Injection

All dependencies will be registered and resolved through a DI container (using VContainer or Zenject), allowing for:

- Loose coupling between components
- Easier testing through mock implementations
- Runtime flexibility and configuration

### Reactive Programming

The application will leverage UniRx (Reactive Extensions for Unity) to:

- Handle asynchronous events
- Manage state changes
- Create responsive UI updates
- Connect data streams between layers

## Feature Breakdown

### Clock Feature

- **Time Service**: Core service for accessing system time
- **TimeZone Management**: Support for displaying different time zones
- **Clock View**: Analog and digital display options
- **Interfaces**: `ITimeService`, `IClockPresenter`, `IClockView`

### Timer Feature

- **Timer Service**: Countdown timer functionality
- **Notification System**: Audio and visual alerts when timer completes
- **Timer Controls**: Start, pause, resume, reset
- **Timer View**: Display with intuitive controls
- **Interfaces**: `ITimerService`, `ITimerPresenter`, `ITimerView`, `INotificationService`

### Stopwatch Feature

- **Stopwatch Service**: Precise time tracking
- **Lap Recording**: Track and display multiple lap times
- **Stopwatch Controls**: Start, pause, resume, reset, record lap
- **Stopwatch View**: Display for elapsed time and lap records
- **Interfaces**: `IStopwatchService`, `IStopwatchPresenter`, `IStopwatchView`

## Navigation System

- Tab-based navigation between features
- Persistent clock display while using other features
- Responsive layout for different screen orientations and sizes

## Integration Interface

- Create a clean API for external applications to interact with clock features
- Define integration points for work operation applications
- Document interface methods and expected behaviors

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture

- Create Unity project with proper configurations
- Set up version control
- Install required packages
- Implement core architecture and DI framework
- Create folder structure

### Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation

- Implement Time Service and related interfaces
- Build basic UI for each feature
- Implement core functionality for Clock, Timer, and Stopwatch
- Create tests for core services

### Phase 3: Feature Integration & Navigation

- Implement navigation system between features
- Ensure features can coexist and operate simultaneously
- Refine UI for responsiveness
- Test integrated features

### Phase 4: Integration Interface & Future Compatibility

- Design and implement integration interfaces
- Create mock demonstrations of integration capabilities
- Document API for future developers

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance

- Comprehensive testing across all features
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX evaluation and refinement

### Phase 6: Documentation & Build

- Complete project documentation
- Generate Windows build
- Document iOS/iPad considerations

## Future Considerations

- iOS/iPad deployment
- Potential VR compatibility
- Work operation application integration
- Additional clock features (world clock, alarms, etc.)

## Development Process

The development process will follow an iterative approach, with regular testing and refinement of features throughout implementation.
